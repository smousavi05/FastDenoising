# Fast Denoiser
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a very simple denoising code for seismic data. It contains two different basic thresholding functions and works in continuous wavelet domain. 
# You should try this one if my other denoisers did not work well on your data.

`demo.m` includes all info you need to know for running the code. 

you need `MATLAB statistics` and `signal processing toolboxes` to run this code.
